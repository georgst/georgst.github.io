**Georg Stadler**  
Professor of Mathematics, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University.

**Contact**  
Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, 251 Mercer Street, New York City, NY 10012, USA  
Phone: +1 212 998 3111 · Office: #929 Warren Weaver Hall · Email: [stadler@cims.nyu.edu](mailto:stadler@cims.nyu.edu)

**Research focus**  
Applied and computational mathematics, in particular **Bayesian inverse problems**, **optimization with PDEs**, **parallel scientific computing**, and **uncertainty quantification**. Applications include **climate modeling and inference**, **fusion**, and **geophysics**.

**Activities / Roles**  
- **Teaching:** In fall 2023 I’ll teach Scientific Computing, and co-teach a PhD-level class on Computational PDEs.  
- **Organization:** Co-organizer of Courant’s Computational Mathematics and Scientific Computing Seminar.  
- **Funding:** Research supported by NSF (DMS-1723211) and currently by an ONR MURI and the Simons Foundation.

**Group**  
Current PhD students: Sonia Reilly (NYU). Former PhD students: Chen Li, Shanyin Tong, Melody Shih, Karina Koval, Yair Daon (NYU), Tobin Isaac and Johann Rudi (both at UT Austin, co-advised with Omar Ghattas).  
Current postdocs at NYU: Fortino Garcia, Gabriel Provencher-Langlois. Recent former postdocs at NYU: Andrew Giuliani, Matt Dunlop, Florian Wechsung, Andy Davis, Huy Dinh.

**Postdoc / student opportunities**  
We are always looking for motivated PhD students and postdocs to join the group. PhD students should apply through Courant’s Mathematics (or CS) PhD program. If you are interested in working in my group as a postdoc (and have read some of my work), please email me.
