I'm a Professor of Mathematics at NYU's Courant Institute. My research is in applied and computational mathematics with emphasis on Bayesian inverse problems, PDE-constrained optimization, numerical algorithms at scale, and uncertainty quantification. Current applications are in climate (sea and land ice, tsunamis), plasma physics (fusion), and earth science.
